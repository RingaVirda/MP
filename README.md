# Programming assignment 3
I can't explain how long it took for me to break through all this file system shit, especially permissions, why in the hell does one need to specify necessary permissions in manifest and in the same time ask them in real time from the user. And also there is a difference between requests in different sdk levels and in sdk 30 this here app doesn't work 'cause for some reason android tells access granted and literally in the next line throws an UnauthorisedAccessException.

Then it was wery difficult to understand and make work all of this fragments in a navigation. For some reason android has 4 different apis at the same time or something, and none of them works because of conflicts. 

After all it performs exactly the same as on that vid in assignment. Also switches tabs after being rotated, something that i thought i don't have to face any issues, but here we are i guess.
